# Archive Notice

The `delphin.edm` plugin has been bundled into [PyDelphin](https://github.com/delph-in/pydelphin/) as of version 1.7.0. This repository will now be archived and further development should happen in PyDelphin.

> # delphin.edm
>
> Elementary Dependency Matching ([EDM][]; [Dridan and Oepen, 2011][])
> is a metric for comparing two semantic dependency graphs that annotate
> the same sentence. It requires that each node is aligned to a
> character span in the original sentence.
>
> The newer [smatch][] metric is essentially the same except that
> instead of relying on surface-aligned nodes it finds a mapping of
> nodes that optimizes the number of matching triples. The search uses
> stochastic hill-climbing, whereas EDM gives deterministic results.
>
> ## Installation and Requirements
>
> This module works with Python 3.6 and higher, and it is a [namespace
> package][] of [PyDelphin][].
>
> This module can be installed via `pip`:
>
> ``` console
> $ git clone https://github.com/delph-in/delphin.edm.git
> $ pip install delphin.edm/
> ```
>
> ## Usage
>
> Once installed, `edm` is a subcommand of PyDelphin's `delphin`
> command. The basic usage is:
>
> ``` console
> $ delphin edm GOLD TEST
> ```
>
> `GOLD` and `TEST` may be files containing serialized semantic
> representations or [[incr tsdb()]][itsdb] test suites containing
> parsed analyses.
>
> For example:
>
> ``` console
> $ delphin edm test/kim.gold.eds test/kim.test.eds
> Precision:	0.9344262295081968
>    Recall:	0.9193548387096774
>   F-score:	0.9268292682926829
> ```
>
> Per-item information can be printed by increasing the logging
> verbosity to the `INFO` level (`-vv`). Weights for the different
> classes of triples can be adjusted with `-A` for argument structure,
> `-N` for node names, `-P` for node properties, `-C` for constants, and
> `-T` for graph tops. Try `delphin edm --help` for more information.
>
> ## Differences from Dridan and Oepen, 2011
>
> Following the [mtool][] implementation, `delphin.edm` treats constant
> arguments (`CARG`) as independent triples, however unlike [mtool][]
> they get their own category and weight. `delphin.edm` also follows
> [mtool][] in checking if the graph tops are the same, also with their
> own category and weight. One can therefore get the same results as
> [Dridan and Oepen, 2011][] by setting the weights for top-triples and
> constant-triples to 0:
>
> ``` console
> $ delphin edm -C0 -T0 GOLD TEST
> ```
>
> `delphin.edm` can optionally ignore missing items on the gold side,
> the test side, or both. Missing items can occur when `GOLD` or `TEST`
> are files with different numbers of representations, or when they are
> [[incr tsdb()]][itsdb] test suites with different numbers of analyses
> per item. For example, to ignore pairs where the gold representation
> is missing, do the following:
>
> ``` console
> $ delphin edm --ignore-missing=gold GOLD TEST
> ```
>
> ## Relevance to non-EDS Semantic Representations
>
> While EDM was designed for the semantic dependencies extracted from
> Elementary Dependency Structures ([EDS][]), it can be used for other
> representations as long as they have surface alignments for the nodes.
> This implementation can natively work with a variety of DELPH-IN
> representations and [formats][codecs] via the `--format` option,
> including those for Minimal Recursion Semantics ([MRS][]) and
> Dependency Minimal Recursion Semantics ([DMRS][]). Non-DELPH-IN
> representations are also possible as long as they can be serialized
> into one of these formats.
